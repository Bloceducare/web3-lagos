        <h3>Our Success Story</h3>
        <p>
          Web3Bridge's mission is to identify Web3 passions, train them in a collaborative and 
          supportive remote environment and create an African Web3 Community. We have over the years  
          executed this mission through our learning series called “COHORT” from edition 1 to edition 7 
          and with more than 2000 trained on Web2 &amp; Web3 Blockchain development for free with access to 
          accommodation, feeding and internet access at our learning facility in Lagos.
        </p>
        <p>
          An initiative that started as 500 Nigerian Developers for Ethereum with results has scaled into an 
          organization that has contributed to growth, development of leading Blockchain projects including Hydro, 
          Nahmii and many others and have exposed not less than 10,000 Africans to Web3 and its wealth of opportunities 
          through educational and extended learning series.
